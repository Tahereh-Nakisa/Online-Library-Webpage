Quirks simulates larval fish foraging behavior and growth physiology.

The files "Quirks_1.01.R" and "Quirks_1.01.R.doc" (with code-highlighting) each contain the full model code, as well as parameterizations for four types of fish larvae and an example demonstrating how to use Quirks.

You can run Quirks from an R console by entering:
source("http://sourceforge.net/projects/larvalfishquirks/files/Quirks_1.01.R",verbose=T)
